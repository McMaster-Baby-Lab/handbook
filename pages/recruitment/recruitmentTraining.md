## Recruitment and Customer Service Training
It is important to recognize we are asking parents to do us a huge favor to have their infant/children contribute to science. We want to convey this excitement and gratitude while recruiting for their (potential) participation i.e. through your verbal communication skills.

Be positive and friendly on the phone – representing the lab We need to ensure they understand and are comfortable with what we are saying. How we say things plays a big part in whether parents choose to participate or not so think about how you would like someone to ask you to do a favour and what would influence your decision. 

- Refer to the parent and child by name in the system
- Only contact parents during working hours – ie. 9:30 am-6:30 pm
- If parents ask a question and you don’t know the answer ask them to hold and ask someone who might know, or tell them you will note it down and get back to them either through phone or email (don’t make up an answer)

**Practice before calling!**

## Vocabulary
Remember that parents are unlikely experts in psychology. Science jargon that we often used to describe our work may sound very strange to them. To effectively communicate with parents, please pay attention to the words and expressions used in your conversations with them.

Here are a few examples for you to prepare your conversations:

|  **Words to AVOID** 	|             **Preferred words & expressions**            	|
|:-------------------:	|:--------------------------------------------------------:	|
| Experiment          	| Studies, Project, Game, etc                              	|
| Discriminate        	| Tell the difference between...                           	|
| Assessment          	| Measure                                                  	|
| Research subject    	| Participant                                              	|
| Infant habituation  	| A perceptual task                                        	|
| Stimuli             	| Face images, Vocal sounds, etc                           	|
| Measure performance 	| Record how long they look at a picture on the screen.... 	|
| Test your baby      	| Your child will see/hear....                             	|
| ...			      	| ...						                             	|

## Typical Workflow
- Open everything you will need quick access to (DRDB, teams, AVAYA, lab calendars, lab email, recruitment script)
	- Might also be helpful to have paper and pen in case you need to write a question down or for any other reason

- **Make the call to the family**
	- Always make phone calls the primary method of contacting families for recruitment – they answer the quickest, they can ask questions they might have that might increase the likelihood they participate, speaking to someone about having their child participate in a study is much more reassuring than an email from people they don’t know.

- **If they answer:**
	- Have a pleasant and clear greeting - Tell them who you are, where you’re calling from and why, ask how they are, etc.
	- Mention whether the study is online or in-person.
	- Make it clear how long the study is and what the study entails – what will the participant be doing.
	- Let them know how they benefit from participating.
		 - If you caught them at a bad time ask when it might be better to call you back or if they would prefer an alt method of contact i.e. email and if their email isn’t in DRDB then write it down and update the system (or update simultaneously from DRDB).
		 - If **uninterested** ask if they would like to be kept in the database and potentially contacted for future studies or if they’d like to be removed from the database and avoid future contact (if so remove them) and thank them for their time.
		- If **interested** but would like some time to consider send them an email regarding interest and ask them to contact you back when they have decided either through email or the lab phone number provide our email and phone number through the phone/in the email babylab@mcmaster.ca or (905)525-9140 ext. 23130 (ask them if they would rather be contacted again and when would be the best time to do that).
        - *** Always confirm their email address when scheduling an appointment or if sending an interest email***

## Email recruitment/confirmation
- Sometimes it's noted that families prefer to be contacted through email so do that first.
- Also if the family doesn’t pick up the phone call send an “interested” email from DRDB so you can give them the information and they can always contact back to participate if they would like to.
- When family/parents have agreed to participate make sure the email contains the correct Zoom link.
- Have links somewhere you can easily copy and paste experimenters’ Zoom links so they can be added to the appointment email sent during the call and/or for the appointment confirmation email.
- Make sure to check the email frequently and consistently – like voicemail families may not pick up calls because they are busy and we want to make sure those who want to participate have the opportunity to.

**Scheduling families**
- Use the *Study Schedule* page to recruit participants for a given study.
- Use the *Family Information* page to recruit participants, only if you want to recruit a particular participant.

**What to check before scheduling:**
- Researcher availability - we can’t have a study scheduled for a researcher who isn’t free or is already scheduled to run a different study at that time.
- Where: Check the researcher’s calendar (in the students’ calendar list) to see her/his availability.
