- To listen to message hit 2, to go to next message press 6
- Reply to messages relevant to your study
	 - Important to check this frequently and consistently because families are busy with school and other activities but might be interested in participating so its important to get back to them

### Lab Email & Calendar

    Account: babylab@mcmaster.ca

Everyone needs to share their availability with the lab calendar, so that others will know when a researcher is available to run studies.

If you are new to the lab, please create a Google Calendar with your McMaster email address, and create events in the calendar for the typical times during the week that you are NOT available to run studies.
- To create a new calendar, go to Outlook Calendar, click the + next to 'Other calendars' on the left side of the screen, and create a calendar.
- Rename this calendar with your own name. 
- After you have created events for all the times you are unavailable to run studies, click on the three dots next to this calendar on the left 'My calendars' toolbar, and click 'Settings and sharing.' 
- Under 'Share with specific people', share the calendar with babylab@mcmaster.ca, macbabylab@gmail.com or the primary researcher on your study.

**Booking Test Slots**
- Typical week: each project should create no more than 8 tentative slots in the lab calendar (not your shared calendar)
	name the event: TENTATIVE + the study name
	i.e. TENTATIVE + Face Detection and include the technology used in the notes
- Input tentative slots into the lab calendar a week in advance
- You may book more than 8 slots for the current week but not a week in advance
	
**Filling Test Slots**
- Login to SONA and create corresponding tentative events in correct timeslots

- Once slots have been signed up for by students update the lab calendar by removing “TENTATIVE” from event title 
- Include participant contact info in the note section of calendar event
