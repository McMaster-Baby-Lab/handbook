### Follow-up

Look at each potential answer from parents to see next steps for recruitment for following-up with families. 

 - Not every family agrees to participate in the study the first time we contact them.
- Parents often need time to decide. It is our responsibility to re-contact these families 2 days after the initial contact.
- Use *Follow-ups* button on *Family Information* page to show the families that we need to contact. The Note for next contact box includes the reason why we need to re-contact this family.

#### **Parent agrees to participate with specific date/time**

- If the date/time works for the experimenters update the schedule with study date/time and experimenters on the *Study Schedule* or *Family Information* page. 
- If the date/time does not work for us, offer another appointment date and time based on the experiementer's availability and Lab Calendar by calling the family. 

**Apointment time decided** 
- Update the schedule with the study date/time and experimenters on the *Study Schedule* or the *Family Information* page.

#### **Parent agrees to participate without a specific date/time**

- Offer a study date/time based on experimenters availability on Lab Calendar by calling the family 

#### **Parent says "no" to participation**
- Thank the parent for their time
- Update the scheudle as *Reject* on either *Study Schedule* or the *Family Information* page. 

#### **No answer on the phone**
- If there is no answer after calling a family 3 times 
- Update the schedule as *Reject* on either *Study Schedule* or *Family Information*
