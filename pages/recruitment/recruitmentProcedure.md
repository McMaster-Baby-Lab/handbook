### Calling a Family

There are several possible outcomes when calling a family. Follow the path for each option to see the workflow of recruitment based on the parent's answer.

2. Select the _Schedule a Study for this Child_ drop down menu

#### **Family agrees, appointment time decided**

- Confirm the parent's email
- Select *Confirmed* in the system 
- Propose a study date/time based on experimenter's availability 
- Enter the appointment date and time
- Choose experimenter (s)

#### **Family showed interest, appointment time not decided**

Sometimes families need time to check their schedule or consider participating. In this case, we send them a follow-up email to see if they wish to participate after they have had a chance to think about it. 

1. Confirm child's name, date of birth, and age
2. Confirm parent email
3. Select _interested_
4. Click on the mail icon, and then click _confirm a tentative appointment_.

    - This button will generate an email template to determine the family’s interest.

5. Proofread the generated email and select _send email_
6. Select next to proceed to the _next contact_ tab. You can now select when you wish to contact the family again (default 2 days).
7. Select _complete_ to finish this process.

- The participant’s participation status will now show as TBD meaning to be determined.

### Follow-up

Look at each potential answer from parents to see next steps for recruitment for following-up with families. 

 - Not every family agrees to participate in the study the first time we contact them.
- Parents often need time to decide. It is our responsibility to re-contact these families 2 days after the initial contact.
- Use *Follow-ups* button on *Family Information* page to show the families that we need to contact. The Note for next contact box includes the reason why we need to re-contact this family.

Please review some of the possible outcomes of a follow-up contact: 


**Parent agrees to participate with specific date/time**

- If the date/time works for the experimenters update the schedule with study date/time and experimenters on the *Study Schedule* or *Family Information* page. 
- If the date/time does not work for us, offer another appointment date and time based on the experiementer's availability and Lab Calendar by calling the family. 

[Refer to these instructions](#family-agrees,-appointment-time-decided)


**Parent agrees to participate without a specific date/time**

- Offer a study date/time based on experimenters availability on Lab Calendar by calling the family 

#### **Parent says "no" to participation**
- Thank the parent for their time
- Update the scheudle as *Reject* on either *Study Schedule* or the *Family Information* page. 

#### **No answer on the phone**
- If there is no answer after calling a family 3 times 
- Update the schedule as *Reject* on either the *Study Schedule* or *Family Information* pages
