## How does email reminder work?

The system automatically sends a reminder email to the family and experimenter at 3pm the day before the study. If a participant doesnâ€™t have an email in the system, an email will be sent to the lab email to remind the researcher to call the participant to remind them of the appointment.   


## What should I do when I find errors in participant's info?

In DRDB, use the pencil icon to edit the family's information and make the necessary changes directly in the system.
