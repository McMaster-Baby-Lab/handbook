## How do the email reminders work?

The system automatically sends a reminder email to the family and experimenter at 3pm the day before the study. If a participant doesnâ€™t have an email in the system, an email will be sent to the lab email to remind the researcher to call the participant to remind them of the appointment.   


## What should I do when I find errors in participant's info?

In DRDB, use the pencil icon to edit the family's information and make the necessary changes directly in the system.

## What is the switch at the top right corner that says "Working Mode/Training Mode"?

DRDB allows you to practice with the system to get a sense of how it works. To practice recruitment, ensure the switch at the top of the screen is set to *Training Mode*. When you send an email in training mode or create a new family - nothing happens, it's just for practice! To actually recruit participants and make changes in the system, you must be in *Working Mode*.
