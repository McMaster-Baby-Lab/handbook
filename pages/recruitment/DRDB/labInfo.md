## Create & edit lab inforamtion

On the *Settings* page the Admin  will have the option to create the lab. The Admin and Lab manager both have the option to edit the lab information. There is the option to edit the lab's name, location, zoom link, email opening and closing, thank you snippet, and transportation instructions. 

## Setup Google account

To link the lab's google account navigate to the *Settings* page and select *Setup Google Account*. From here, sign into the desired account. 

This page may pop up. Navigate through it using the buttons below. 

<img src="../../../assets/images/vocab.jpg" alt="download" align="right" width="240"/> 

{% include oneImg.html url="../../../assets/images/vocab.jpg" caption = "" shortCap="" %}

{% include oneImg.html url="../../../assets/images/google1.jpg" caption = "" shortCap="Google Setup1" %}

{% include oneImg.html url="assets/images/GoogleSetup/google2.jpg" caption = "Google Setup-2" shortCap="Google Setup-2" %}

Allow all 7 permissions for DRDB. 

You will then see this page. This is expected. 

{% include oneImg.html url="assets/images/GoogleSetup/google3.jpg" caption = "Google Setup-3" shortCap="Google Setup-3" %}

You need to take the URL and copy the part of the URL between **/?code=** and **&scope** and paste it into the next screen. 

{% include oneImg.html url="assets/images/GoogleSetup/google4.jpg" caption = "Google Setup-4" shortCap="Google Setup-4" %}
