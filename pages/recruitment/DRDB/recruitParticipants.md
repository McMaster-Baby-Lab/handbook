### Participate in multiple studies per visit

**Typical Scenario**

Before scheduling a participant for a study, it is important to check if they are elligible to participate in any other studies in the lab. We want to make the most of the participant's time and effort to come in person to the lab so we should try to collect data for multiple studies if possible. If you see that a participant is elligible for another study, coordinate with the lead researcher on that study to see if they would also like to test the participant. 

**How-to**

1. If the participant's name is highlighted under additional appointments, this means that they are elligible for other studies. 
2. Click on their name to add another study when booking the appointment. Elligible studies will be highlighted 

**Demo**

### Participate with siblings, who are also eligible for a study

**Typical Scenario**

Before scheduling a participant for a study, it is also important to check if they have siblings that are elligible for any studies. If they do, you can ask the guardians whether they would like to bring the sibling in as well to participate and coordinate with the lead researcher on that study to see if they would like to test the sibling. 

**How-to**

1. Enter the scheduling screen
2. If the names are highlighted in blue the child or their siblings are eligible for other studies
3. Click their names and check the eligible studies from the drop down menu
4. Delete an appointment using the garbage can

## Follow up with previously contacted families

**Typical Scenario**

If a family says they need time to think or the family does not respond to our phone call, lab members need to follow-up with the family in a timely manner to see if they are still interested in participating. DRDB allows lab members to filter by participants who require follow-up. 

**How-to**

1. Navigate to the _Family Information_ page
2. Select the _follow-ups_ tab at the top of the screen
3. Navigate through the families requiring follow-up using the arrows
