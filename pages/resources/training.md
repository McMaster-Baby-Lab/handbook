## What do I need for recruitment?
### AVAYA
We use the phone of our lab to contact families. With Avaya IX (Softphone), you can call participants with lab’s phone number on your computer/cell phone.

- To listen to message hit 2, to go to next message press 6
- Reply to messages relevant to your study
	 - Important to check this frequently and consistently because families are busy with school and other activities but might be interested in participating so its important to get back to them

### Lab Email & Calendar

    Account: babylab@mcmaster.ca
    Password: Princeton220~
    
Everyone needs to share their availability with the lab calendar, others will know when a researcher is available to run studies.
           
For those who are new to the lab, please create a Google Calendar with your McMaster email address, and create events in the calendar for the typical times during the week that you are NOT available to run studies. 

To create a new calendar, go to Outlook Calendar, click the + next to 'Other calendars' on the left side of the screen, and create a calendar. Rename this calendar with your own name. After you have created events for all the times you are unavailable to run studies, click on the three dots next to this calendar on the left 'My calendars' toolbar, and click 'Settings and sharing.' Under 'Share with specific people', share the calendar with babylab@mcmaster.ca or the primary researcher on your study. 

### McMaster VPN
The McMaster VPN is needed to access our Developmental Research Database (DRDB) where we store the information of potential participants in our studies. You can download the McMaster VPN using this link: [McMaster VPN](https://uts.mcmaster.ca/services/computers-printers-and-software/virtual-private-networking/)

### Zoom (for online studies)
Use experimenter’s McMaster Zoom account (with your MacID) running studies.
- Retrieve your Personal Zoom Meeting URL:
	- Click My Profile and find your Meeting URL under Personal Meeting ID section · URL looks like this: https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/ + [[Personal Meeting ID]]
- Save your Zoom meeting URL to the Study Management System [DRDB](https://drdb.mcmaster.ca/)
- Go to Personnel management page, and update your profile with Zoom meeting URL
- Ensure you turn on your waiting room in settings 

## Recruitment and Customer Service Training
It is important to recognize we are asking parents to do us a huge favor to have their infant/children to contribute to science. We want to convey this excitement and gratitude while recruiting for their (potential) participation i.e. through your verbal communication skills. 

Be positive and friendly on the phone – representing the lab We need to ensure they are understand and are comfortable with what we are saying. How we say things plays a big part of whether parents choose to participate or not so think about how you would like someone to ask you to do a favour and what would influence your decision. Practice before calling!

- Refer to the parent and child by name in system
- Only contact parents during working hours – ie. 9:30 am-6:30 pm
- If parents ask a question and you don’t know the answer ask them to hold and ask someone who might know, or tell them you will note it down and get back to them either through phone or email (don’t make up an answer)

### Vocabulary
Don’t use science jargon!
- Avoid words like: experiment on, discriminate, motor assessment, research subject, infant habituation, measure performance, visual stimuli, test your baby.
- Do use words like project, fun activities, participants, games.

### Typical Workflow 
- Open everything you will need quick access to (DRDB, teams, AVAYA, lab calendars, lab email, recruitment script)
	- Might also be helpful to have paper and pen in case you need to write a question down or for any other reason

- Make the call to the family
	- Always make phone calls primary method of contacting families for recruitment – they answer the quickest, they can ask questions they might have that might increase the likelihood they participate, speaking to someone about having their child participate in a study is much more reassuring than an email from people they don’t know. 

- If they answer:
	- Have a pleasant and clear greeting - Tell them who you are, where you’re calling from and why, ask how they are etc.
	- Make sure to mention testing is online through zoom – can mention it is convenient and from their home, don’t need to come in, flexible times for those in school or with busy lives
	- Make it clear how long the study is and what the study entails – what will the participant be doing
	- Let them know how they benefit from their participation
	- If you caught them at a bad time ask when it might be better to call you back or if they would prefer an alt method of contact i.e. email and if their email isn’t in DRDB then write it down and update the system (or update simultaneously from DRDB)
	- If uninterested ask if they would like to be kept in the database and potentially contacted for future studies or if they’d like to be removed from the database and avoid future contact (if so remove them) and thank them for their time
	- If interested but would like some time to consider send them an email regarding interest and ask them to contact you back when they have decided either through email or the lab phone number provide our email and phone number through the phone/in the email babylab@mcmaster.ca or (905)525-9140 ext. 23130 (ask them if they would rather be contacted again and when would be the best time to do that)
	- *** always confirm email address when scheduling an appointment or if sending interest email***


Email recruitment/conformation
- Sometimes its noted that families prefer to be contacted through email so do that first
- Also if the family doesn’t pick up the phone call send an “interested” email from DRDB so you can give them the information and they can always contact back to participate if they would like to
- When family/parents have agreed to participate make sure the email contains the right zoom links
- Have links somewhere you can easily copy and paste experimenters’ zoom links so they can be added to the appointment email sent during the call and/or for the appointment confirmation email
- Make sure to check the email frequently and consistently – like voicemail families may not pick up calls because they are busy and we want to make sure those who want to participate, do

Scheduling families
- Use Study Schedule page to recruit participants for a given study.
- Use Family Information page to recruit participants, only if you want to recruit a particular participant.

What to check before scheduling:
- Researcher availability - we can’t have a study scheduled for a researcher who isn’t free or is already scheduled to run a different study at that time
- Where: Check researcher’s calendar (in students’ calendar list) to see her/his availability

Follow-up with families
- Not every family agrees to participate in the study the first time we contact them. 
- Parents often need time to decide. It is our responsibility to re-contact these families 2 days after the initial contact.
- Use Follow-ups button on Family Information Page to show the families that we need to contact. The Note for next contact box includes the reason why we need to re-contact this family.
