### Lab Email & Calendar

    Account: babylab@mcmaster.ca
    Password: Princeton220~
    
Everyone needs to share their availability with the lab calendar, others will know when a researcher is available to run studies.
           
For those who are new to the lab, please create a Google Calendar with your McMaster email address, and create events in the calendar for the typical times during the week that you are NOT available to run studies. 

To create a new calendar, go to Outlook Calendar, click the + next to 'Other calendars' on the left side of the screen, and create a calendar. Rename this calendar with your own name. After you have created events for all the times you are unavailable to run studies, click on the three dots next to this calendar on the left 'My calendars' toolbar, and click 'Settings and sharing.' Under 'Share with specific people', share the calendar with babylab@mcmaster.ca or the primary researcher on your study.
