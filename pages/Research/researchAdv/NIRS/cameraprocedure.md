### Camera Usage and Experiment Recording Backup Procedure 

 
The camera (Go Pro camera) in the infant lab is used for recording an entire experiment session. The content of the recordings will later be used for data analysis and other research purposes. The following steps are the procedure for us to use the camera and backup the recordings. 

 

#### Camera preparations 

1. Make sure SD card is in the camera: *If the SD card is not inside, you will see “NO SD Card” on the camera screen.* 
2. Make sure the power cord is connected to power and attached to the camera. 
3. Make sure the camera captures the area where infant participants will sit: *You can see the preview of the camera on the NIRS machine.*

 Camera recording 
1. Press the “O” button on top of the camera to record video. *Once recording starts, you should see a timing clock on the camera screen.*
2. Press the “O” button again to stop a recording. Once recording stops, you should see a number on the camera screen, which indicates the number of videos currently stored in the SD card. This number should increase by 1 once you stop a recording. 
3. Make sure to STOP recording while mothers are breastfeeding their children during experiment break. 


#### Video backup 

1. Copy the video files to an iMac 

    - Take out the micro-SD card from the camera, and insert it to the bigger SD case. This case is in the center drawer of Mac 3. 

    - Insert the SD card to the SD card slot on a iMac, which is on the right-hand side. 

    - You should see a disk  icon appears on the desktop. 

    - Open the disk icon and find video recordings in one of the sub-folders. 

    - Copy and paste the videos to Desktop, then eject the SD card from iMac 

    - Put the micro SD card back to the camera and put the camera back to the lab. Also put the SD card case back the drawer. 

2. Upload videos to Google Drive 
    1. Open Google Drive under the ESDL@kangleelab.com account 
    2.  Open folders “Visual Speech Project” -> “VS-NIRS Recordings” 
    3.  Create a folder for each participants, whose videos are going to be uploaded. 
    4. The name of participant folder follow this rule: Child’s First Name_Test Month_Test Date_Test Year. The “Test Month” should be labeled in letters, rather than digits. For example, A participant named George participated in our study on January 10th, 2016. We should create a folder named “George_Jan_10_2016”. 
    5. Upload all the videos of one participant into corresponding folder. You need to open the folder first, click the New button on the left upper corner, and choose “File upload” to upload video. 
    6. Once uploading started, you should see a progress bar at the right lower corner of the screen. 
    7. Do NOT close the Google Drive window until upload succeeds. If necessary, put a sticker on the computer to warn people from touching the computer. 

3. Once all the videos are uploaded, remove the videos from computer and SD card 
- Delete the videos on the desktop. 
- Delete the videos on the SD card. You can do so on the camera when the SD card is inside. There is an option on the camera to remove all videos. 

4. Upload photos to Google Drive by following the same procedure of Step 2. 

5. Copy the shared link of each folder to the Recruitment sheet.
