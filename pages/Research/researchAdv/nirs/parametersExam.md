### NIRS Parameters Examination

The NIRS machine sometimes will reset its parameters to default setting, which would result in issues such as losing stimuli marks and trial numbers. Given the fact that we have no clue how this happens, we need to double check the settings of the NIRS before collecting any data. This parameter examination is very simple, requiring two steps: 

1. Check Stimuli Record Type. 
    - Click “Operation Measurement Event” button 

    - In the pop-up menu, make sure there is a “√” in front of Event 

    - If “Event” is not checked, check it by clicking. 

2. Load parameter preset. 
    - Click “Parameter Set Serial” button 
    
    - In the pop-up window “Parameter”, there is a dropped-down box at the top, named “parameter Name” 
    - In this drop-down box, select “Infant VS preset” and click Import button.
