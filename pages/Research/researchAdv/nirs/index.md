## How does fNIRS measure brain activity?
FNIRS is a safe and non-invasive technique for measuring localized blood flow/volume in the human brain. FNIRS employs nearly identical methods to the pulse oximeter which has been employed extensively for decades in clinical settings to monitor blood oxygen levels during surgery and for high-risk individuals during hospitalization (e.g., infants born prematurely).  
This technique has been widely used in our every life. Apple Watch or similar wearable health-tracking devices also use this technique to monitor blood flow changes. 
 
FNIRS is based on the fact that hemoglobin absorbs near-infrared wavelengths in proportion to the state of blood oxygenation. Importantly, brain activation is correlated with increased metabolic demand, and the ratio of oxyhemoglobin/deoxyhemoglobin concentration has been shown to be a reliable index of neural activity. These changes in blood oxygenation are also the physiological correlate of neural activity used in fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) recordings. FMRI employs a combination of fluctuations in magnetic fields and radio waves are used to measure changes in blood oxygenation in the brain. Thus, fNIRS records similar physiological signals as fMRI while using light. 
 
FNIRS works by shining a near-infrared light source (delivered via fiberoptic) onto the exterior of the scalp and using a photodetector to sample the variations in light scattered back from the brain surface. 


## Safety when using fNIRS
There are no known medical risks associated with fNIRS because the light source(s) are not intense (less than 1 mw/cm2), the light sources are largely transparent to biological tissue (i.e., there is insufficient absorption to cause heating), and the light source(s) and photodetectors are placed on the surface of the scalp using a comfortable headband.  
 
FNIRS has been used to study perceptual and cognitive processing in adults and infants for over 20 years. Dr. Xiao has been extensively trained in fNIRS recordings particularly with newborns, infants, and adults. Dr. Xiao will be closely involved in all aspects of fNIRS research in the lab from training research personnel to data analysis.
