### How to Take a Break in the Middle of a fNIRS Test 

It is normal for an infant participant to get bored or fussy during an experiment. Given the emotional status of the participant, we can choose different strategies to handle the situation and ensure the quality of neuroimaging data. 


If the baby becomes fussy or bored (not look at the screen during stimuli presentation): 

1. 	E1 signals E2 to take a break; 

2. Turn the lights on, and see whether the baby gets better. Sometimes, infants get anxious when they stay in a dark room for a long time; 

3. If the baby gets better, do the following: 
    - Play with the baby with bubbles and/or toys 
    - Let the parent also play with the baby 
    - Play for 1~2 minutes 
    - Resume testing if the baby becomes happy and the parent agrees 
    

4.  If the baby is still unhappy, do the following: 
    - Press “Pause” button on the NIRS computer 
    - Take pictures of the NIRS cap (frontal, left, and right sides) 
    - Take off the cap, and open the cap to cool it down 
    - Play with the baby, or lead the baby and parent back to the warm-up room 
    - Check with the parent if the baby needs to change diaper or needs to be fed 
    - If the baby gets better, and the parent agree to resume, resume testing 
    - After having the cap on, press “Unpause” button on the NIRS computer, and do “Auto Gain” to measure the channels are good 
    - Wait for 10 seconds to allow NIRS computer finishing a Pre-scan procedure 
    - Turn off the light and start the stimuli presentation 

  

It should be noted that we should **NOT** press the Stop button for taking a break under any circumstance. 

There is also **NO** need to do anything on the Experiment computer to take a break.
