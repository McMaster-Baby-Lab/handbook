## Online studies
1) Have AVAYA running (AVAYA IX (softphone)) to call parents/answer calls

2) Have Lab Calendar and email open to respond if parents message 

3) Have the DRDB system open to reschedule if necessary

4) If parent does not enter the room in 5 min, call to check if they have problems accessing the link using AVAYA

5) Plan to set up the testing at least 10-15 minutes before the testing begins. This will provide enough time to:
   * Ensure the program is running 
   * Verify your internet connection and battery
   * Locate the study weblink
   * Prepare your tracking sheet (participant ID, condition, etc) 
   * Disable all computer notifications (e.g., emails)
   * Answer calls/emails from parents to reschedule
   * Log into password-protected Zoom room
   * Check that your settings allow multiple people to share their screen in Zoom
 
6) Open zoom and admit participants to the call

7) After admitting participants, welcome and greet them!

- Explanation of the study: 
  - XXX, let me tell you about the study you will be participating in today. This study takes about X minutes. We just want to know how you react!

  - We are gonna video record the session so that we can collect the data later. So by default, this video is private.

### **Post-Testing**

- Ask the participant how they would like us to use the recorded video from the session and outline the different levels of use: 

  * Level 1:  The video stays in our secure servers, and only members of our research team can see it.
  * Level 2 allows us to show this video for academic/educational use. We might show this video as an example at scientific conferences or classes, but we won’t distribute copies of this video to anyone.
