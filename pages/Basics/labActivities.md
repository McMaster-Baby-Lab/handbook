## Lab communication

Our primary mode of communication among the team will continue on Microsoft Teams.
Here you may find recaps from our lab meetings, important training files/documents, as well as other “mini tasks” that you have the option to help complete.

## Lab Space

### Lab Ettiquette

Once you enter the lab space, please leave all personal items in PC-333/334.
It is not recommended to leave any personal items such as laptops or other valuables in the lab space overnight.

When families are present in the lab for testing with other lab members, please ensure that you are quiet and professional so that we do not disrupt the family during the experiment.

Please make sure that you are quiet when walking in the hallways outside of our lab space as well. We are surrounded by many other labs who may be running studies and require a non-distracting environment.

### Accessing the space

Please ensure that you bring your access cards to enter the lab space.
Our lab space is located on the 3rd floor of the psychology building.
Hold your access card against the black box beside the door that grants access to the experimentation section of the building until a green light appears.
Once you enter this section of the 3rd floor, turn right and walk down to the end of the hall. The first door in front of you, as well as the door to your right will lead to our lab space. If you don’t have a card/forget to bring it please call the lab space to have someone bring you in.

Do not lend your access card to anybody else, especially not to anyone who is not a member of our lab.

Every time your access card is used, your MacID is registered and recorded.
This also means that you should not be using your access card to allow other students who are not part of our lab and are not participants, into the lab space. 

If you lose your access card, please contact Dr. Xiao and register for a new one as soon as possible. We will work to deactivate your existing card so that it may no longer be used to enter our lab space and a new one will be created for you.

To enter the lab space, you must put in the following code into the lock box to obtain the key: **1280**
As soon as you open the door, immediately put the key back into the lock box.
Do not share the code to our lock box with anyone outside of the lab.

### Leaving the space

Please ensure both doors are closed if you are the last person leaving the lab. Closing the doors is extremely important for security reasons. 

## Lab meetings

Lab meetings will be held in person on DATETIME

You are expected to attend lab meetings but in the case that a conflict arises, please refer to the posted agenda found on Microsoft Teams to catch up on missed information.

### Journal Club

Journal club is an opportunity for the lab to discuss recent papers published in the field during lab meetings. During journal club, students will present and critically analyze a research paper. 

Each independent study/thesis student will present 1 paper chosen by the student and approved by the supervisor. The journal will be assigned to the student and the student will select a paper from their assigned journal. The student will then briefly present the paper at the lab meeting. PowerPoint slides are not permitted, students only need to describe the paper verbally in a 3 minute maximum presentation. After the presentation, lab members will have an opportunity to ask the student questions about the paper and engage in discussion. 

**Article requirements:**
-	Empirical research article or review papers. Commentary articles, report, or correspondence articles are NOT qualified.
-	Articles published in the past 3 years.
-	Articles never presented at our lab meeting before (check Journal club channel on Teams for past presented papers).
- Articles that lab members did NOT participate in.

**Here are some tips for your reading and presentation:**
- Make sure you understand the research question the paper is attempting to answer.
-	What is the general method of the study and how did the researchers use the method to address the research question?
- What the meaning of the study in terms of its theoretical and practical contributions.
-	Who are the authors, are there trainees (students, post-docs, and staffs) in the authors, or all authors are professors from different university?
-	What is the specialty of the authors’ lab(s)?
-	What are the things you like or dislike about the article?
-	THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG PRESENTATION. BE YOURSELF.


## Project meetings
You will work alongside a group of other students on a project - please ensure that you are following up with them regularly to complete all tasks.
In the case that you are unable to complete a specific task or require more time, please communicate clearly with the rest of your team members. 


## Lab shifts

It is expected that you are on time for your shifts - please feel free to come 15-20 minutes early if you need time to set up before meeting a family.

Familiarize yourself with your schedule and what dates/times you are expected to be in the lab.
Our current lab schedule can be found here: Lab Schedule (Shifts)
If you are unable to attend your shift, please reach out to others working at the same time as you to coordinate them covering for you.
This is especially important if you are planning to meet a family during your scheduled shift.

Please stay up to date with the lab calendar to ensure that you are aware of all scheduled appointments. 


Please stay home if you are feeling ill and inform Dr. Xiao and others who can cover for you during your scheduled time.
This is especially important to ensure that we do not pass anything on to other lab members as well as our participants!


## Training

We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to progress our research. Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use them.

## Lab socials

The lab will aim to have a social gathering once per term. More details to come soon.
