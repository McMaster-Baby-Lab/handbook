## Lab meetings

The lab meeting schedule will be provided at the beginning of each semester. All lab members are expected to attend. 

The spring/summer lab meeting schedule can be accessed here: [Spring/Summer Term Lab Meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKimiWTpUe4PQL3tFgEDz_NydGFLITvv2hTn5xdvS1c/edit?usp=sharing)

Please inform Dr. Xiao if the lab meeting time does not work for you. 

You are expected to attend lab meetings but in the case that a conflict arises, please refer to the posted agenda found on Microsoft Teams to catch up on missed information.

## Journal Club

Journal club is an opportunity for the lab to discuss recent papers published in the field during lab meetings. During journal club, students will present and critically analyze a research paper. 

- Each independent study/thesis student will present 1 paper during a lab meeting. 
- The journal will be assigned to the student and the student will then select a paper from the journal they are assigned to. 
- The student will then briefly present the paper at the lab meeting. 
  - PowerPoint slides are not permitted, students only need to describe the paper verbally in a 3-minute maximum presentation. 
- After the presentation, lab members will have an opportunity to ask the student questions about the paper and engage in discussion. 

**Article requirements:**
-	Empirical research articles or review papers. Commentary articles, reports, or correspondence articles do NOT qualify.
-	Articles published in the past 3 years.
-	Articles never presented at our lab meeting before (check Journal club channel on Teams for past presented papers).
- Articles that lab members did NOT participate in.

Submit your article here so that it can be uploaded to our teams channel: [Journal Club Paper Upload](https://forms.office.com/r/9pDG7gw244)

**Here are some tips for your reading and presentation:**
- Make sure you understand the research question the paper is attempting to answer.
-	What is the general method of the study and how did the researchers use the method to address the research question?
- What the meaning of the study in terms of its theoretical and practical contributions?
-	Who are the authors, are there trainees (students, post-docs, and staff) in the authors, or all authors are professors from different universities?
-	What is the specialty of the authorsâ€™ lab(s)?
-	What are the things you like or dislike about the article?
-	THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG PRESENTATION. BE YOURSELF.

## Mini Tasks 
The lab frequently offers students opportunities to work on mini tasks, such as literature review, learning to use new software, and programming. 

Students are encouraged to take on tasks that align with their interests and career developmental goals, which may help them achieve their future career aspirations. 

Mini tasks are posted in the *Mini Tasks* channel in Microsoft Teams. 

**Tasks may include:**
- Literature reviews: collecting and summarizing research on a topic
- Study preparation: creating experimental stimuli, programming
- Data collection: run studies as an experimenter
- Data analysis: pre-processing and statistical analyses
- Software development: develop modules for the research management system

## Project meetings
You will work alongside a group of other students on a project - please ensure that you are following up with them regularly to complete all tasks.

In the case that you are unable to complete a specific task or require more time, please communicate clearly with the rest of your team members. 

## Lab shifts

Lab shifts are an opportunity to work on tasks for your assigned study and also assist with other in-person studies. Lab shifts allow students to gain hands-on experience and develop skills while assisting with in-person research using the eyetracker and fNIRS technology. 

Lab shifts also allow students to build relationships with other lab members and learn from other students in the lab. Students can work together to discuss challenges and prepare for the next stages of their projects. 

Each student will be required to have several hours of lab shifts each week. 

During lab shifts, students should be working on assisting with recruitment, in-person studies, mini-tasks or other project-specific tasks. 


## Training

We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to progress our research. 

Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use them.

## Lab socials

The lab will aim to have a social gathering once per term. More details to come soon.
