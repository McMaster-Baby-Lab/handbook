## Lab Etiquette

**Personal Items:** 
   - Once you enter the lab space, please leave all personal items in student offices.
   - It is not recommended to leave any personal items such as laptops or other valuables in the lab space overnight.

**Noise Level:**
   - When families are present in the lab for testing with other lab members, please ensure that you are quiet and professional so that we do not disrupt the family during the experiment.
   - Please make sure that you are quiet when walking in the hallways outside of our lab space as well. We are surrounded by many other labs who may be running studies and require a non-distracting environment.

**Doors:** 
   - Ensure the **doors** to the lab space and within the lab space are **closed** if a study is taking place or **if there is no one in the lab.** 
   - When beginning a study, please flip the door sign to in progress so that other lab members know not to disrupt the study. 
   - After the study, change the door sign back to the picture. 

**Dress Code:**
   - Please ensure that you are dressed appropriately for a work setting while in the lab. We want to ensure professionalism when interacting with participants and running studies.

**Kitchen Area & Food Storage:**
   - Food and drinks are permitted in the lab space but not permitted in testing areas. Food should never be left out, especially overnight. 

   - There is a Keurig Coffee Maker in the lab, please feel free to bring your own coffee pods. 
   - There is also a kettle, fill it with water and push down on the switch at the back to start boiling.
   - There is also a microwave, please ensure you clean it after each use. 

**Cleaning the space:**
   - Please help keep the lab space clean!

   - Please keep the kitchen clean and clean all dishes/utensils after use. Please also clean any appliances you use after you are finished. 

   - If you choose to eat/drink anything please ensure that you are throwing out any garbage in the appropriate bins. Cans cannot go in the lab recycling and must be discarded in the bin beside the elevators. Please ensure your workspace is left clean when you leave the lab.

   - Once a family has left, please clean all toys in the waiting area. 

   - If your shift is on Friday afternoon, please vacuum the lab space if there are no participants in the lab.

   - Cleaning supplies can be found in the kitchen area.
