	- After uploading the files, if you want to free up hard drive space, you can right click the files and click "Free Up Space"
	- You can always download the files whenever you need
- This is especially useful for large files, such as video recordings

## Types of research data

- Participant response data, downloaded from Pavlovia.org
- Questionnaire data, downloaded from MS Forms
- Participant tracking sheet
For infant studies, you need to back up the following data:
- Program output data, downloaded from Pavlovia.org (used for locating onsets of each trial)
- Zoom recording data, downloaded from Zoom
- Looking time coding data, generated by Datavyu
- Questionnaire data, downloaded from MS Forms
- Participant tracking sheet

### How to Name Files
Data file naming convention: Participant_Session_fileType
- Participant # should be digits, matching the record on Participant tracking sheet
- Session # is used for multi-session studies (studies run multiple times on different days)
	- fileType represent the type of file such as: 
		- Pavlovia
		- Zoom
		- Coding
		- Questionnaire
- For example, 3_1_zoom.avi means this is the recording for participant #3's first session
