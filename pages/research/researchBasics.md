#### Consent forms
#### Study
#### Debrief

### with infants & children

## Communication with Families
Families may be emailed via DRDB and the lab email. Please make sure to check the lab email frequently and respond to any emails in a timely manner. 
To call families, please use the phone in our lab space.

Please ensure that communication with families is professional at all times.
Be respectful when attending to their needs and answering any questions
In the case that you do not have an answer to a question posed by a family, feel free to let them know that you will get back to them as soon as possible and seek guidance from another lab member who can provide an answer.

#### Prior to the study 
Make sure to send an email providing the address of the university and where the closest parking lots are in front of the Psychology Building. Please provide clear communication about parking tickets to the families. Inform them that they should park in front of the building and we will provide them with a free parking pass that they may put on their windshield.

Provide clear directions to the location of the building and a meeting spot (such as the front lobby) so you can guide them to our lab space. Ask the family to call the lab phone once they have arrived so we can send someone to guide them to our lab space. 

Please find out whether the family will be bringing any siblings. 
If another child will be attending, ensure that another experimenter is present to take care of the sibling. We have toys and books to keep the children busy. 

#### When the family arrives
Make sure to stay near the lab phone 5-10 minutes before the family is set to arrive so that we can answer their phone call letting us know that they are here. Greet the family in the lobby of the building and guide them to the lab space. Make sure to bring the parking pass with you when you greet the family so that you can help them put it on their car.

Once you guide the family to the lab, ask the family to take a seat in the waiting area and thank them for taking the time to help us with our research today. You may offer the family water to help them get settled in. Please do not offer any other refreshments as we are not aware of any allergies or other conditions.

Give the parents consent forms to sign before the study begins and answer any of their questions.

Ask whether the family is interested in us taking pictures of their visit. If they are interested, please have them sign the consent form. If they consent, we may use these photos to decorate the lab space. 

Once the testing room is available and the consent forms have been signed, guide the family to the testing room. If possible, set a sign on the door to inform others in the lab that the room is being used for testing (this will ensure that you are not disrupted during the testing process).

#### Study
Go through the study script. Make sure to familiarize yourself with this script in advance! 

Even if something goes wrong with the technology, continue to run through the study as we do not want to disappoint the family. 

#### Debrief
Debrief with the family after the experiment is complete. The debriefing period will be project dependent, but we may mention more about who we are, what we do, our general progress, as well as how their contribution will be used.

If the family requests the results, let them know that we can provide the average results of the group, but are unable to provide specific data collected with their child.

#### Compensation
Provide the family with their gift of choice after the study is complete and guide them back out of the building. Again, be sure to thank them for their time and contribution.

#### Timing
Try to keep all meetings with the family within an hour. This is especially important to ensure that we can keep all appointments running smoothly and on time to respect others who may need to use the testing spaces as well.

If they have questions that exceed their 1 hour visit, please let them know that you would be happy to answer more of their questions via phone or email.

In the case that a family is late and you have to leave at a certain time, please communicate with others in the lab to cover part of the shift for you.
Please be clear with the family that you must leave at a certain time during the study and that another lab member will be happy to step in for the remainder of their visit.

#### Family Accomodations
If the family requires a space to change the baby’s diaper, direct them to the washroom on the 3rd floor. 

If the family requires a space to feed the baby in private, offer a closed space such as one of the testing rooms (double check that there are no cameras on). Please put a sign on the door indicating that no one may enter the room at the time.

### Contingency Plan
If you are suddenly unable to run a study that you are responsible for, reach out to other members familiar with the study to see if they are available to cover. 

## Online studies
### with adults (SONA system)
#### Introduction 
#### Verbal consent
#### Zoom
#### Post-Testing

### with infants & children
#### Prior to the study
1) Have AVAYA running (AVAYA IX (softphone)) to call parents/answer calls

2) Have Lab Calendar and email open to respond if parents message 

3) Have the DRDB system open to reschedule if necessary

4) If parent does not enter the room in 5 min, call to check if they have problems accessing the link using AVAYA

5) Plan to set up the testing at least 10-15 minutes before the testing begins. This will provide enough time to:
   * Ensure the program is running 
   * Verify your internet connection and battery
   * Locate the study weblink
   * Prepare your tracking sheet (participant ID, condition, etc) 
   * Disable all computer notifications (e.g., emails)
   * Answer calls/emails from parents to reschedule
   * Log into password-protected Zoom room
   * Check that your settings allow multiple people to share their screen in Zoom
 
6) Open zoom and admit parents to the call

7) After admitting parents, welcome and greet them! 

#### Introduction to the study
Greeting: 
Hi XXX Hi XXX. My name is XX, and I am the researcher who will be playing a game with you. Are you having a good day so far? Okay. I have a really fun game to play with you today. I just need to get the game set up first. First, I am going to share my screen with you (after sharing, check with parents to see if they can see the screen that you share with them).

Explanation of the study to the parent: 
XXX, let me tell you about the game that XXX is going to play. 
This game takes about 5 minutes. And In this game, XXX is going to XXX. We just want to know how your child reacts!

We are gonna video record the session so that we can remember how XXX plays the game. So by default, this video is private. That means, This video is only saved in our secure servers—we won’t show it to anyone else unless we have your explicit consent. Ask permission to begin recording and inform them that they will have to select "continue" to allow the recording.  



Verbal Consent: 
Earlier you should have received an email from us with the information about the consenting process. Before we continue, do you have any questions for us?
[If yes, answer their questions. Once they are comfortable moving forward, proceed. If they decide they are not comfortable proceeding at this point, thank them for their time and interest in participating.]

The consent script for the parent to read will be displayed on the screen. Ask the parent to read the script beginning with the phrase "Today is..."

#### Check Device and Settings
Ask what device they are using for the study and ask them how large the screen is. If they are unsure, ask them to estimate. Ask if they are using more than one screen. 

Next, verify that their device is charging during the study. 

Ask them to create a distraction-free environment: Since we are studying baby’s visual attention to faces. We want to create a distraction-free environment. So please move all toys or attractive objects that might divert the Baby's attention on your table, on the computer screen etc. Such as  stickers, or toys. Please minimize pets and other people walking into and out of the room if possible. 


#### Post-Testing
Ask the parent how they would like us to use the recorded video from the session and outline the different levels of use: 

* Level 1:  The video stays in our secure servers, and only members of our research team can see it.
* Level 2 allows us to show this video for academic/educational use. We might show this video as an example at scientific conferences or classes, but we won’t distribute copies of this video to anyone.
* Level 3 allows us to share this video for public use. We might put copies of this video on our website for public outreach or share it alongside scientific publications. 

Ask which level best describes how they’d like us to use their child’s video. 

Ask the family the questions in the questionnaire and check which gift card they would like to receive for their participation. 

Thank the family for their participation. 

#### After ending the call
Update the tracking sheet and testing notes. Be sure to write down any interruptions and make note of the child's mood. 

Update the participant fee sheet to ensure compensation is received.
