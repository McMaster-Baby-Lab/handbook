## Communication with Families
Families may be emailed via DRDB and the lab email. Please make sure to check the lab email frequently and respond to any emails in a timely manner. 
To call families, please use the phone in our lab space.

Please ensure that communication with families is professional at all times.
Be respectful when attending to their needs and answering any questions
In the case that you do not have an answer to a question posed by a family, feel free to let them know that you will get back to them as soon as possible and seek guidance from another lab member who can provide an answer.

## In-person studies
### with adults
#### Directions to lab
#### Consent forms
#### Study
#### Debrief

### with infants & children

#### Prior to the study 
Make sure to send an email providing the address of the university and where the closest parking lots are in front of the Psychology Building. Please provide clear communication about parking tickets to the families. Inform them that they should park in front of the building and we will provide them with a free parking pass that they may put on their windshield.

Provide clear directions to the location of the building and a meeting spot (such as the front lobby) so you can guide them to our lab space. Ask the family to call the lab phone once they have arrived so we can send someone to guide them to our lab space. 

Please find out whether the family will be bringing any siblings. 
If another child will be attending, ensure that another experimenter is present to take care of the sibling. We have toys and books to keep the children busy. 

#### When the family arrives
Make sure to stay near the lab phone 5-10 minutes before the family is set to arrive so that we can answer their phone call letting us know that they are here. Greet the family in the lobby of the building and guide them to the lab space. Make sure to bring the parking pass with you when you greet the family so that you can help them put it on their car.

Once you guide the family to the lab, ask the family to take a seat in the waiting area and thank them for taking the time to help us with our research today. You may offer the family water to help them get settled in. Please do not offer any other refreshments as we are not aware of any allergies or other conditions.

Give the parents consent forms to sign before the study begins and answer any of their questions.

Ask whether the family is interested in us taking pictures of their visit. If they are interested, please have them sign the consent form. If they consent, we may use these photos to decorate the lab space. 

Once the testing room is available and the consent forms have been signed, guide the family to the testing room. If possible, set a sign on the door to inform others in the lab that the room is being used for testing (this will ensure that you are not disrupted during the testing process).

#### Study
Go through the study script. Make sure to familiarize yourself with this script in advance! 

Even if something goes wrong with the technology, continue to run through the study as we do not want to disappoint the family. 

#### Debrief
Debrief with the family after the experiment is complete. The debriefing period will be project dependent, but we may mention more about who we are, what we do, our general progress, as well as how their contribution will be used.

If the family requests the results, let them know that we can provide the average results of the group, but are unable to provide specific data collected with their child.

#### Compensation
Provide the family with their chosen gift card after the study is complete and guide them back out of the building. Again, be sure to thank them for their time and contribution.

## Timing
Try to keep all meetings with the family within an hour. This is especially important to ensure that we can keep all appointments running smoothly and on time to respect others who may need to use the testing spaces as well.

If they have questions that exceed their 1 hour visit, please let them know that you would be happy to answer more of their questions via phone or email.

In the case that a family is late and you have to leave at a certain time, please communicate with others in the lab to cover part of the shift for you.
Please be clear with the family that you must leave at a certain time during the study and that another lab member will be happy to step in for the remainder of their visit.
