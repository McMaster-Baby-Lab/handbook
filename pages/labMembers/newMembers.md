## Code of Conduct 

The lab is a place for all individuals to feel safe and welcome - this is important for all members of our lab as well as our participants.

Please help us ensure that our environment is safe and accepting of all.
No discrimination or harrassment based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, religion, age, physical appearance etc. will be tolerated. 

Please ensure that you are speaking professionally and respectfully (avoid inappropriate language) when in the lab, regardless of whether participants are present or not. 

If you are taking any photos or videos in the lab, please ensure that you have the consent of all parties involved. This is especially important if you intend to post any of these pictures online.

Please be respectful of all others working in the lab at the same time as you, as it is a shared space.

This is a safe space for all of us to learn! All opinions and thoughts from volunteers, research students and assistants are valued.

If you have any concerns about your safety or the safety of others in the lab, please reach out to Dr. Xiao or the Psychology HR department immediately.
