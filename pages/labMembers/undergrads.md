## Expectations for All Undergraduate and Research Staff
- Attend weekly lab meetings
- Attend project specific meetings
- Attend scheduled lab shifts
- Participate in special tasks that you can choose based on your interests or assignment (*Mini Tasks* on Teams). Tasks may include:
    - Literature reviews: collecting and summarizing research on a topic
    - Study preparation: creating experimental stimuli, programming
    - Data collection: run studies as an experimenter
    - Data analysis: pre-processing and statistical analyses
    - Software development: develop modules for the research management system

## Additional Position Specific Expectations
### Research Assistants

- You will be asked to commit to a schedule of 5-10 hours of lab work a week. This needs to be the schedule you stick to through the entire semester- this is a research opportunity but it is also your job! If you cannot attend a shift, always check with Dr. Xiao first. 

- You will get paid through the pay system. You must log your hours regularily. 

**Best practices as an RA**
This is both a research opportunity and a job- please remember to treat it as both with the respect they require.
- Be working on a lab task at all times during your scheduled lab hours. (Breaks are ok, sometimes you are doing tedious tasks and need a mental break, but within reason, please!)
- Be on time for your shifts. - There are many moving parts in the lab and your timeliness is usually central to all parts (getting families, watching siblings, answering the phone, etc.)
- Participate actively and thoughtfully in the research projects. Be careful, diligent, and thorough with all of your work.
- Ask questions!
- Have a notebook (or note app on phone) with you at all times to take notes.
- Respond to your personal email promptly. You should check your email at least once a day!
