## Lab Access & Security

- Keep lab doors closed when not in use. 

- Never bring people who are not lab members into the lab (friends, classmates, family members etc.). 

- Only access the lab when you need to for research purposes. No one should be accessing the lab outside of working hours/days if it is not required. 

- Lab passcodes can be accessed here: [Lab Passcodes](https://mcmasteru365.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/labtest/Shared%20Documents/Document.docx?d=wc837cf74eba147a0bfd67fba5c507f4e&csf=1&web=1&e=evf5Cc). Please do not share these passwords with anyone. 

## Lab Shifts & In-Person Research

- It is expected that you are **on time for your shifts** - please feel free to come 15-20 minutes early if you need time to set up before meeting a family.

- Familiarize yourself with your schedule and what dates/times you are expected to be in the lab. Our current lab schedule can be found here: Lab Schedule (Shifts)
   - If you are unable to attend your shift, please reach out to others working at the same time as you to coordinate them covering for you. This is especially important if you are planning to meet a family during your scheduled shift.

- Frequently check the lab calendar to ensure that you are aware of all scheduled appointments. 

- Please stay home if you are feeling ill and inform Dr. Xiao and others who can cover for you during your scheduled time. This is especially important to ensure that we do not pass anything on to other lab members as well as our participants!

## Lab materials and equipment

- Please make sure that you are handling all lab equipment very carefully.
   - We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to conduct our research. Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use it. 
   - If you are unclear about how to use certain equipment, please ask others in the lab for help! 
   - If some of the equipment doesn’t seem to be working properly, please inform Dr. Xiao. 

- There are printers, phones, and computers in the lab, please ensure you are only using them for lab related purposes - they are not meant for personal use! 

- Please do not remove any items (e.g., pencils, pens, and other stationary) from the lab for personal use. Please ensure that all equipment within the lab is left in the appropriate places. 

- If you feel that we are missing something that could be needed for the lab space, please fill out the following form to inform Dr. Xiao: [Lab Shopping Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HcudkN_4lJH5IiXFmxJeXy5JUODkyNzFOMzZBOThKUFA5Ujk2MkNHWEQ4MS4u)

## Leaving the space

- At the end of your shift, please ensure that all emails and phone messages have been attended to. This step is necessary to ensure that the individuals coming in for the next shift are able to get started with their assigned tasks right away.

- Please make sure that at the end of the day (last shift) all of the monitors are turned off. The lights don’t need to be turned off as they are motion detected.

- Please check to make sure that all toys have been cleaned. Lysol wipes may be found in the kitchen area.

- Ensure the doors inside the lab space are closed. Make sure the 2 doors leading to our lab are closed and that the key is securely placed in the lock box.
