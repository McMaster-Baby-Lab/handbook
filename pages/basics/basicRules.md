## Lab communication

- **Microsoft Teams**
   - Here you can find recaps from our lab meetings, important training files/documents, as well as other “mini tasks” that you have the option to help complete.

  - **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional and respectful tone when communicating through Microsoft Teams. Adhere to the lab's code of conduct. 
  - **Updates**: Check Microsoft Teams frequently to be aware of any updates in the lab or changes to lab meetings/scheduling. 
  - **Confidentiality:** Respect the privacy and confidentiality of the lab's discussions and shared files within Microsoft Teams. Do not share sensitive information or confidential data with people who are not in the lab. 
  
- **Meetings and casual conversations**
   
- **Lab Email**
- The lab email is the primary form of communication used between lab members and participants. The lab email is connected to DRDB and used to send interest emails, schedule appointment, and send appointment confirmations to families. 

- **Basic Rules for using the Lab Email:** 
    - **Professionalism:** Maintain a professional tone and language when composing and replying to emails. Be respectful and courteous when composing emails to families. Use an appropriate email signature that includes your name, position, and contact information. 
    - **Subject Line:** Use clear and concise subject lines to describe the email. This helps families identify why you are emailing and makes it easy for lab members to search for specific emails.
    - **Clear Writing:** Be clear and concise when writing emails. Avoid excessive use of jargon or technical scientific terms, and provide context when necessary. Use lay terms, avoiding words like experiment (ie. use study, participate etc.). 
    - **Response Time:** If you are responsible for recruitment, check the lab email frequently and respond in a timely manner to ensure that we are able to secure the participation of families that are interested. 

- **Lab Calendar**
  - The Lab Calendar is used to coordinate the scheduling of studies and meetings for the lab. It is important to check the lab calendar prior to scheduling participants to avoid double booking two studies using the same technology at the same time. 

  Basic Rules for using the Lab Email:
  - Updating the calendar: Keep the lab calendar up-to-date by promptly adding and modifying study appointments and meetings. Regularly review the calendar to stay informed of upcoming activities.
  - Event Details: Label the event with the study name and ensure you have alotted the correct amount of time for the study. Add relevant notes if neccessary. 
  - Collaborative Editing: All lab members have access to edit the calendar, do not delete the entries of others without proper communication. Communicate and coordinate with other lab members to find alternatives if there is a scheduling conflict.

### Lab Ettiquette

Once you enter the lab space, please leave all personal items in student offices.
- It is not recommended to leave any personal items such as laptops or other valuables in the lab space overnight.

When families are present in the lab for testing with other lab members, please ensure that you are quiet and professional so that we do not disrupt the family during the experiment.

Please make sure that you are quiet when walking in the hallways outside of our lab space as well. We are surrounded by many other labs who may be running studies and require a non-distracting environment.

Close the door when


### Leaving the space

At the end of your shift, please ensure that all emails and phone messages have been attended to. This step is necessary to ensure that the individuals coming in for the next shift are able to get started with their assigned tasks right away.

Please make sure that at the end of the day (last shift) all of the monitors are turned off. The lights don’t need to be turned off as they are motion detected.

Please check to make sure that all toys have been cleaned. Lysol wipes may be found in the kitchen area.

Ensure the doors inside the lab space are closed. Make sure the 2 doors leading to our lab are closed and that the key is securely placed in the lock box.

## The use of lab spaces

### Dress code
Please ensure that you are dressed appropriately for a work setting while in the lab. We want to ensure professionalism when interacting with participants and running studies. 

### Food storage
Food and drinks are permitted in the lab space but not permitted in testing areas.

### Cleaning the space
Please help keep the lab space clean!

If you choose to eat/drink anything please ensure that you are throwing out any garbage in the appropriate bins. Cans cannot go in the lab recycling and must be discarded in the bin beside the elevators. Please ensure your workspace is left clean when you leave the lab.

Once a family has left, please clean all toys in the waiting area. 

Cleaning supplies can be found in the kitchen area. 

### Lab materials and equipment

Please make sure that you are handling all lab equipment very carefully.
We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to conduct our research. Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use it. If you are unclear about how to use certain equipment, please ask others in the lab for help! If some of the equipment doesn’t seem to be working properly, please inform Dr. Xiao. 

There are printers, phones, and computers in the lab, please ensure you are only using them for lab related purposes - they are not meant for personal use! 

Please do not remove any items (e.g., pencils, pens, and other stationary) from the lab for personal use. Please ensure that all equipment within the lab is left in the appropriate places. 

If you feel that we are missing something that could be needed for the lab space, please fill out the following form to inform Dr. Xiao: [Lab Shopping Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HcudkN_4lJH5IiXFmxJeXy5JUODkyNzFOMzZBOThKUFA5Ujk2MkNHWEQ4MS4u)
