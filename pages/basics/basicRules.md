> lab cleaning schecules
> how to use kitchen appliances
> food should never be left outside, especially over night.
> close the door, when you leave and whenever there is a study on-going. Relatedly, we should have a rule for door signs (like the one on NIRS room).

## Lab Ettiquette

- **Personal Items:** 
   - Once you enter the lab space, please leave all personal items in student offices.
   - It is not recommended to leave any personal items such as laptops or other valuables in the lab space overnight.

-**Noise Level:**
   - When families are present in the lab for testing with other lab members, please ensure that you are quiet and professional so that we do not disrupt the family during the experiment.
   - Please make sure that you are quiet when walking in the hallways outside of our lab space as well. We are surrounded by many other labs who may be running studies and require a non-distracting environment.

- **Doors:** Ensure the doors to the lab space and within the lab space are closed when leaving the space and if a study is taking place. 


### Leaving the space

At the end of your shift, please ensure that all emails and phone messages have been attended to. This step is necessary to ensure that the individuals coming in for the next shift are able to get started with their assigned tasks right away.

Please make sure that at the end of the day (last shift) all of the monitors are turned off. The lights don’t need to be turned off as they are motion detected.

Please check to make sure that all toys have been cleaned. Lysol wipes may be found in the kitchen area.

Ensure the doors inside the lab space are closed. Make sure the 2 doors leading to our lab are closed and that the key is securely placed in the lock box.

### Dress code
Please ensure that you are dressed appropriately for a work setting while in the lab. We want to ensure professionalism when interacting with participants and running studies. 

### Food storage
Food and drinks are permitted in the lab space but not permitted in testing areas.

### Cleaning the space
Please help keep the lab space clean!

If you choose to eat/drink anything please ensure that you are throwing out any garbage in the appropriate bins. Cans cannot go in the lab recycling and must be discarded in the bin beside the elevators. Please ensure your workspace is left clean when you leave the lab.

Once a family has left, please clean all toys in the waiting area. 

Cleaning supplies can be found in the kitchen area. 

### Lab materials and equipment

Please make sure that you are handling all lab equipment very carefully.
- We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to conduct our research. Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use it. 
- If you are unclear about how to use certain equipment, please ask others in the lab for help! 
- If some of the equipment doesn’t seem to be working properly, please inform Dr. Xiao. 

There are printers, phones, and computers in the lab, please ensure you are only using them for lab related purposes - they are not meant for personal use! 

Please do not remove any items (e.g., pencils, pens, and other stationary) from the lab for personal use. Please ensure that all equipment within the lab is left in the appropriate places. 

If you feel that we are missing something that could be needed for the lab space, please fill out the following form to inform Dr. Xiao: [Lab Shopping Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HcudkN_4lJH5IiXFmxJeXy5JUODkyNzFOMzZBOThKUFA5Ujk2MkNHWEQ4MS4u)
