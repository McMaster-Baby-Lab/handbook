## The use of lab spaces
### Dress code
Please ensure that you are dressed appropriately for a work setting while in the lab. We want to ensure professionalism when interacting with participants and running studies. 

### Food storage
Food and drinks are permitted in the lab space but not permitted in testing areas.

### Cleaning the space
Please help keep the lab space clean!

If you choose to eat/drink anything please ensure that you are throwing out any garbage in the appropriate bins. Cans cannot go in the lab recycling and must be discarded in the bin beside the elevators. Please ensure your workspace is left clean when you leave the lab.

Once a family has left, please clean all toys in the waiting area. 

Cleaning supplies can be found in the kitchen area. 

### Lab materials and equipment

Please make sure that you are handling all lab equipment very carefully.
We are lucky to have access to these expensive devices that allow us to conduct our research. Please make sure that you complete all appropriate training before using the equipment so that you are well educated about how to use it. If you are unclear about how to use certain equipment, please ask others in the lab for help! If some of the equipment doesnâ€™t seem to be working properly, please inform Dr. Xiao. 

There are printers, phones, and computers in the lab, please ensure you are only using them for lab related purposes - they are not meant for personal use! 

Please do not remove any items (e.g., pencils, pens, and other stationary) from the lab for personal use. Please ensure that all equipment within the lab is left in the appropriate places. 

If you feel that we are missing something that could be needed for the lab space, please fill out the following form to inform Dr. Xiao: [Lab Shopping Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=B2M3RCm0rUKMJSjNSW9HcudkN_4lJH5IiXFmxJeXy5JUODkyNzFOMzZBOThKUFA5Ujk2MkNHWEQ4MS4u)
