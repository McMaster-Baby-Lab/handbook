## The use of lab spaces
### Dress code
Please ensure that you are dressed appropriately for a work setting while in the lab. We want to ensure professionalism when interacting with participants and running studies. 

### Food storage
Food and drinks are permitted in the lab space but not permitted in testing areas.

### Cleaning the space
Please help keep the lab space clean!

If you choose to eat/drink anything please ensure that you are throwing out any garbage in the appropriate bins. Cans cannot go in the lab recycling and must be discarded in the bin beside the elevators. Please ensure your workspace is left clean when you leave the lab.

Once a family has left, please clean all toys in the waiting area. 

Cleaning supplies can be found in the kitchen area. 

### Lab materials and equipment

There are printers, phones, and computers in the lab, please ensure you are only using them for lab related purposes - they are not meant for personal use! 

Please do not remove any items from the lab for personal use (e.g. pencils, pens, and other stationary. Please ensure that all equipment within the lab is left in the appropriate places.
